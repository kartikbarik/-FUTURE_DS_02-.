##  Objectives
-  Categorize customer issues using text analysis
-  Identify frequently reported problems
-  Highlight inefficiencies in current response workflows
-  Recommend automation opportunities and process improvements
##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
  - `pandas`: for data manipulation and cleaning
  - `nltk`: for natural language processing and keyword analysis
- **Google Colab and MS Excel**: for interactive analysis
